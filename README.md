## miscellaneous notes

- cmd + b = run from main
- cmd + r = run current scene
- cmd + . = stop runing
- **_cmd + shift + A_**
  - = "import" an _instance_ of an other scene as a child node, which packages/hides that other scene's own children from view of the current scene
  - you have to save the original instance for the "imported" instances to update to match
  - to make one of those instances different from the rest, right-click > check Editable Children > now you can see the children and edit for that instance
- cmd + d = duplicate
- cmd + c --> cmd + v = create child
