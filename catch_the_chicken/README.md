# Notes to self:

- make sure to rename "Catch the Chicken Game.html" to "index.html"
- `bash zip.sh`
- [exporting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html)
  - you'll need to have downloaded "Export templates"
    - from within Godot, Export Template Manager > Download and Install, or
    - from links lower down in this page https://godotengine.org/download and then Install Export Templates so that you can use them to export (without red error messages preventing Export Project)
